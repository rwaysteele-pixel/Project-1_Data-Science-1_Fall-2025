# From Paper Audits to Data Science
***
Why would a community college registrar in a rural town pursue a degree in data science? Find out why and why all higher education professionals should become more data science literate!

## Plan
In the future, I plan to include a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to this repository. 

## About Me
Hi All! My name and Rachel, and I'm new to data science. As a higher education professional, I have sought to make data-driven decisions to best support students. Now it's time to take it to the **next level**! I hope to
  *Improve administrative efficency at the institutional level
  *Use data to be an advocate for community colleges
  *Advance my career
