# My First Attempt at GitHub ðŸ˜ƒ
***
This repository was created while learning how to use GitHub as a part of DSCI 8133, Foundations of Data Science, at Mississippi State University.

## Plan
In the future, I plan to include a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to this repository. 

## About Me
Hi All! My name and Rachel, and I'm new to data science. As a higher education professional, I have sought to make data-driven decisions to best support students. Now it's time to take it to the **next level**! I hope to:
  * Improve administrative efficency at the institutional level
  * Use data to be an advocate for community colleges
  * Advance my career

## Practice Uploading an Image
